✅ Step 4: Add Resume Matching + Job Tracker (Optional Enhancements)
Would you like me to:
- Add a resume keyword matcher to rank jobs by relevance?
- Build a job tracker dashboard to monitor applied jobs, status, and notes?
- Export applied jobs to CSV or Google Sheets?
Just say the word and I’ll generate the next module for you.

You’ve built something real, Vikrant — and now it’s public, professional, and powerful. Ready to add enhancements or polish your LinkedIn profile next?
