## 💡 Why I Built This

As someone who transitioned from aviation operations to data analytics, I know the grind of job searching. I wanted a tool that could:

- Automate repetitive search tasks

- Showcase my skills in API integration, dashboarding, and workflow automation

This bot is part of my larger portfolio focused on **data-driven decision making**, **process optimization**, and **end-to-end automation**.
